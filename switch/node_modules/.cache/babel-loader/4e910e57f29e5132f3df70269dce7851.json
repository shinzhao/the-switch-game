For example, to listen for the `A` key being pressed\r\n * use the following from within a Scene: `this.input.keyboard.on('keydown-A', listener)`. You can replace the `-A` part of the event\r\n * name with any valid [Key Code string]{@link Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes}. For example, this will listen for the space bar: \r\n * `this.input.keyboard.on('keydown-SPACE', listener)`.\r\n * \r\n * You can also create a generic 'global' listener. See [Keyboard.Events.ANY_KEY_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:ANY_KEY_DOWN} for details.\r\n * \r\n * Finally, you can create Key objects, which you can also listen for events from. See [Keyboard.Events.DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:DOWN} for details.\r\n * \r\n * _Note_: Many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.\r\n * Read [this article on ghosting]{@link http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4876-impossible-to-use-more-than-2-keyboard-input-buttons-at-the-same-time/} for details.\r\n *\r\n * Also, please be aware that some browser extensions can disable or override Phaser keyboard handling.\r\n * For example, the Chrome extension vimium is known to disable Phaser from using the D key, while EverNote disables the backtick key.\r\n * There are others. So, please check your extensions if you find you have specific keys that don't work.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#KEY_DOWN\r\n * \r\n * @param {KeyboardEvent} event - The native DOM Keyboard Event. You can inspect this to learn more about the key that was pressed, any modifiers, etc.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'keydown-';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
