This occurs when the duration timer equals or exceeds the duration\r\n * of the transition.\r\n * \r\n * Listen to it from a Scene using `this.scene.events.on('transitioncomplete', listener)`.\r\n * \r\n * The Scene Transition event flow is as follows:\r\n * \r\n * 1. [TRANSITION_OUT]{@linkcode Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:TRANSITION_OUT} - the Scene that started the transition will emit this event.\r\n * 2. [TRANSITION_INIT]{@linkcode Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:TRANSITION_INIT} - the Target Scene will emit this event if it has an `init` method.\r\n * 3. [TRANSITION_START]{@linkcode Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:TRANSITION_START} - the Target Scene will emit this event after its `create` method is called, OR ...\r\n * 4. [TRANSITION_WAKE]{@linkcode Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:TRANSITION_WAKE} - the Target Scene will emit this event if it was asleep and has been woken-up to be transitioned to.\r\n * 5. [TRANSITION_COMPLETE]{@linkcode Phaser.Scenes.Events#event:TRANSITION_COMPLETE} - the Target Scene will emit this event when the transition finishes.\r\n * \r\n * @event Phaser.Scenes.Events#TRANSITION_COMPLETE\r\n * \r\n * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene -The Scene on which the transitioned completed.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'transitioncomplete';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
