For example, to listen for the `A` key being released\r\n * use the following from within a Scene: `this.input.keyboard.on('keyup-A', listener)`. You can replace the `-A` part of the event\r\n * name with any valid [Key Code string]{@link Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes}. For example, this will listen for the space bar: \r\n * `this.input.keyboard.on('keyup-SPACE', listener)`.\r\n * \r\n * You can also create a generic 'global' listener. See [Keyboard.Events.ANY_KEY_UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:ANY_KEY_UP} for details.\r\n * \r\n * Finally, you can create Key objects, which you can also listen for events from. See [Keyboard.Events.UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:UP} for details.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#KEY_UP\r\n * \r\n * @param {KeyboardEvent} event - The native DOM Keyboard Event. You can inspect this to learn more about the key that was released, any modifiers, etc.\r\n */\nmodule.exports = 'keyup-';","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
