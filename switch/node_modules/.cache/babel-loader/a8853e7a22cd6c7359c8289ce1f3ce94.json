I.e. collided with the top of the world bounds.\n * @param {boolean} down - Is the Body blocked down? I.e. collided with the bottom of the world bounds.\n * @param {boolean} left - Is the Body blocked left? I.e. collided with the left of the world bounds.\n * @param {boolean} right - Is the Body blocked right?
